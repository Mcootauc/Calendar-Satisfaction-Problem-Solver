Calendar Satisfaction Problem Solver is a java program that provides a solution for scheduling some n meetings in a given period of time. The meetings are also according to some unary and binary constraints on the dates of each meeting. 

An unary constraint is a constraint on a single variable and a binary constraint is a constraint over a pair of variables. 

The goal is to provide a working schedule based on the unary and binary constraints on the dates of each meeting in the given period of time.

Using node consistency and arc consistency, the program makes sure that every unary or binary constraint on a variable is satisfied by all values in the domain of the variable. The purpose of this program is to practice using array lists, nodes, arcs, and domains.
